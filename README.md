## 🏁 Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/soundscape-generator.git
cd soundscape-generator


cd backend
npm install
npm run start


cd ../frontend
pnpm install
pnpm run dev



🔮 Future Scope
🔧 Codebase Improvements
Modular frontend:

Reusable TrackCard, FilterPanel, AudioPlayer components

Custom hooks for API logic (useTracks, useMoodGenre)

Backend restructuring (MVC):

🧠 LLM + Spotify + AI Roadmap
Goal: Smart music recommendation based on user's natural language input like

"Play something ambient and cinematic to relax my mind"

Steps:
🎧 Spotify API Integration

Use Spotify Web API to fetch live track metadata

Store title, artist, mood tags, audio features

🧠 LLM Processing

Use an LLM (e.g., GPT-4, Hugging Face) to interpret user mood queries

Generate semantic vector for the query

🔎 Vector Matching

Embed song metadata into vector space

Match user prompt vector to nearest songs using:

cosine similarity

vector DB (e.g., Pinecone, Qdrant, or local Faiss)

🎯 Final Recommendation

Return matching Spotify links or previews

Improve accuracy using feedback loop (likes/dislikes)

🚀 Example Future Use Case
User: “Suggest lo-fi beats for a night drive”
→ LLM analyzes tone → Converts to mood vector
→ Backend finds best matches via vector similarity
→ Frontend displays embedded Spotify links

Let me know if you want me to also:
- Generate folder scaffolding with empty files (`controllers/`, `models/`, etc.)
- Write boilerplate for Spotify API calls
- Help with vector embedding using `openai-embeddings`, `sentence-transformers`, etc.

I'm here to assist with the next phases too!
